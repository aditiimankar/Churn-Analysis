# Churn-Analysis using ML Models

High churn is observed when monthly charges are high, which is an expected insight.
A surprising insight is that there is higher churn among customers with lower total charges.
Derived insights show that high churn is associated with month-to-month contracts, lack of online security and tech support, the first year of subscription, and fiber optics internet.
Low churn is seen among customers with long-term contracts, subscriptions without internet service, and those who have been engaged for 5+ years.
Factors such as gender, phone service availability, and the number of multiple lines have minimal impact on churn, as indicated by the heatmap.
Electronic check is the payment medium with the highest churn rate.
Monthly customers without contract terms are more likely to churn.
Customers without online security and tech support are prone to higher churn rates.
Non-senior citizens exhibit higher churn rates.
Accuracy alone is not a suitable metric for imbalanced datasets. Precision, recall, and F1 score for the minority class (churned customers) should be considered.
The random forest model achieved an accuracy score of 0.7889.
